Recipe Recommender System
Built an end-to-end AI-powered recipe recommendation platform that suggests recipes based on available ingredients or target cuisine.

Ingredient-based recommender: Uses TF-IDF + Nearest Neighbors to find recipes with high ingredient overlap.

Cuisine-based recommender: Uses TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity on combined recipe text to recommend dishes from a selected cuisine.

Computer vision integration: YOLOv8 model detects ingredients from uploaded images for automatic recipe suggestions.

Interactive web app: Deployed using Streamlit with a simple UI for ingredient input, image upload, and mode toggle (Ingredient / Cuisine).
